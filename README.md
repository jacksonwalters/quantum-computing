# shor_algorithm
An implementation of Shor's algorithm for IBM Qiskit. https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-algorithms/shors-algorithm

Currently factors $N=15$. 

Working on parameterizing the modular multiplication gates $U_a$ whose circuits are currently defined by hand for values of $a$ which are coprime to $N$.
